OpenErp Snippets
================

This is a sublime <http://www.sublimetext.com/> package which includes a bunch of handy snippets for doing OpenERp development.

Snippets borrowed from open-erp-eclipse-template <http://code.google.com/p/openerp-eclipse-template/>
and openerp-snippets <https://bitbucket.org/pcaro/openerp-snippets>

Instalation
===========

With Package Control
--------------------

If you have the Package Control <http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control> package installed, you can install OpenErp Snippets from inside Sublime Text itself. Open the Command Palette and select "Package Control: Install Package", then search for OpenErp Snippets.

It's just that simple!

Without Package Control
-----------------------

If you haven't got Package Control installed (seriously, go install it!) you will need to make a clone of this repository into your packages folder.

Then, create a package-metadata.json file::

    {
        "url": "https://github.com/kng3dX/openerp-snippets.git",
        "version": "1.0",
        "description": "Code snippets for developing with OpenErp"
    }
